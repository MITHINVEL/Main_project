# ðŸ”§ Notification Empty Issue Fix

## Problem
Notifications showing empty but you know there's 1 notification. This happens because of aggressive filtering.

## Quick Solutions

### Solution 1: Clear Suppressed Notifications (Easiest)
```dart
// Add this button to your notifications screen
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.remove('suppressed_signatures_v1');
    // Refresh the screen
  },
  child: Text('Reset Notification Filters'),
)
```

### Solution 2: Check Firestore Documents
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Open Firestore Database  
3. Check `notifications` collection
4. Look for documents with your `createdBy` field
5. Check if `isFixed: true` on your notifications

### Solution 3: Temporary Debug Fix
Add this debug code to see what's happening:

```dart
// In notifications_screen.dart, in the StreamBuilder
print('=== NOTIFICATION DEBUG ===');
print('Total docs: ${allDocs.length}');
print('After dedup: ${deduplicatedDocs.length}'); 
print('SMS related: ${allSmsDocs.length}');
print('Pending docs: ${pendingDocs.length}');
print('=========================');
```

### Solution 4: Reset All Filters
Add this method to your notifications screen:

```dart
Future<void> _resetAllFilters() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.remove('suppressed_signatures_v1');
  setState(() {
    _locallyFixedNotificationIds.clear();
    _suppressedSignatures.clear();
  });
}
```

## Common Causes:

1. **Suppressed Signatures**: User marked similar notification as "fixed"
2. **isFixed Flag**: Notification marked as resolved in Firestore
3. **Source Filter**: Only showing SMS notifications, your notification might be different source
4. **Related Lights**: Filtering only notifications with related street lights

## Quick Test:
1. Add debug button to notifications screen
2. Check what filters are removing your notification
3. Clear the specific filter causing the issue

## Most Likely Fix:
Your notification was marked as "fixed" or the signature was suppressed. Clear the suppressed signatures and it should appear!
